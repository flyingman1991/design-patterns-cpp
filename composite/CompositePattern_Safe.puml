note left of client
    This is <font color="Red">"safe mode"</font>.
    Distinguish structure between leaf and branch.
    <font color="Red">Leaf and abstract base Component</font> can not
    manage subobjects.
    Only branch structure can do this.
end note

note left of Component
    The common interface of leaf and branch.
    It can provide some default implementation.
    In <font color="Blue">Transparent mode</font>, it also declare interface
    to access and manager subobjects;
    In <font color="Blue">Safe mode</font>, branch structure manage sub-
    objects instead of Component.
end note

note right of Leaf
    It's a leaf node object in a composition.
    It has no child nodes and is used to inherit
    or implement abstract components
end note

note right of Composite
    It's a branch node object in the composition.
    It has child nodes, which are used to inherit
    and implement abstract components.
    Its <b>main function</b> is to store and <b>manage subassemblies</b>,
    usually including add(), remove(), getchild(), etc.
